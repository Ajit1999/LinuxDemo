Tasks : 2
You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day
and end day variables using arguments -
So Write a bash script create directories.sh that when the script is executed with three given
arguments (one is the directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the
end number of directories ) it creates a specified number of directories with a dynamic directory
name.
Example 1: When the script is executed as
./createDirectories.sh day 1 90
then it creates 90 directories as day1 day2 day3 .... day90

#!/bin/bash
# Check if the number of arguments is correct
if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
echo "Usage: $0 <prefix> <start> <end>"
exit 1
fi
prefix=$1
start=$2
end=$3
# Create directories
for ((i=start; i<=end; i++)); do
mkdir "$prefix$i"
done
echo "Directories created successfully."
